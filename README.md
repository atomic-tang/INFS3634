Weâ€™ve created a quiz application to better prepare IS students for INFS3634 by developing their technical proficiency in Java and Android programming through fragmented learning. Our app organises each of the programming courses into weekly lessons by topic such as loops and objects where students will go through a series of short videos and quizzes and earn a badge upon successful completion of each lesson. This approach delivers learning in smaller chunks to allow students to grasp complex concepts with greater clarity but with greater frequency to consolidate their understanding through practice.
